# üó£Ô∏è Standup Synth

**Standup Synth** is a module of **PlanSync-AI** that automates daily standup meetings by analyzing team activity across GitHub repositories and generating intelligent progress summaries. It replaces traditional standup meetings with AI-powered digests sent via Telegram or webhooks.

---

## üß† What It Does

* Monitors GitHub activity across multiple repositories
* Analyzes commits, pull requests, and issues from the last 24 hours
* Identifies team member contributions and progress patterns
* Uses AI to generate meaningful standup summaries
* Detects blockers, completed work, and upcoming tasks
* Sends formatted digest reports via Telegram or webhook endpoints
* Tracks velocity and progress trends over time
* Provides actionable insights for team coordination

---

## üí° How to Use

### Manual Trigger (Telegram)
Send a message to your connected Telegram bot:

```
/standup
```

Optional parameters:
```
/standup {team-name} {days}
```

* `team-name` ‚Äî Filter by specific team or project (optional)
* `days` ‚Äî Number of days to analyze (default: 1)

### Automated Schedule
The workflow can be configured to run automatically:
* Daily at 9:00 AM (configurable)
* Before scheduled team meetings
* On-demand via webhook triggers

## üõ† Workflow Breakdown

Based on the actual n8n workflow implementation:

| Step                     | Description                                                | Node Type |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Schedule Trigger         | Runs every weekday at 9:00 AM automatically               | Schedule Trigger |
| Variables Configuration  | Sets GitHub repos, team mapping, and notification settings | Code Node |
| GitHub Issues Fetcher    | Collects issues from the last 24 hours                    | GitHub API |
| GitHub PRs Fetcher       | Retrieves pull requests and reviews                       | GitHub API |
| GitHub Commits Fetcher   | Gets recent commits with detailed patch data               | GitHub API |
| Data Merger             | Combines all GitHub activity data                          | Merge Node |
| Activity Classifier     | Categorizes work: completed, in-progress, blocked         | Code Node |
| AI Summary Generator    | Uses Google Gemini to create standup summaries            | LangChain Agent |
| Format for Telegram     | Structures output with Markdown and emojis                | Code Node |
| Telegram Delivery      | Sends digest to configured team chat                       | Telegram Node |

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Parallel Data Fetching**: Multiple GitHub API calls run simultaneously
- **Smart Data Aggregation**: Intelligent merging and filtering of activities  
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Google Gemini generates human-readable standups
- **Rich Formatting**: Telegram-optimized output with emojis and structure
- **Blocker Detection**: Automatic identification of impediments
- **Team Mapping**: GitHub usernames mapped to real names

## üìå About the `Variables` Node

The `Variables` node configures team settings, repositories, and output formatting. You **must customize this node** with your team's configuration.

### ‚úÖ Replace its code with this:

```js
return {
  // GitHub repository to monitor (format: "owner/repo")
  'Start variable': 'https://github.com/chartdb/chartdb {<number>limit: 100}',
  
  
  // Telegram configuration
  'telegram-chat-id': 'YOUR-TELEGRAM-CHAT-ID',
  
  // Time range settings (hours)
  'hours-back': 24,
  

};
```

### üîÅ Replace the placeholders:

* `'Start variable'`: GitHub repository URL with optional task limit
* `'team-members'`: Object mapping GitHub usernames to display names
* `'telegram-chat-id'`: Your Telegram chat ID for notifications
* `'hours-back'`: How many hours of activity to analyze (default: 24)
* `'repo-owner'` and `'repo-name'`: Repository details for GitHub API calls

These values configure the entire workflow for your team's specific setup.
