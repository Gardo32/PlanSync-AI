# üö® Blocker Watchdog

**Blocker Watchdog** is a module of **PlanSync-AI** that continuously monitors for blockers across GitHub, Trello, and Slack, automatically detecting impediments and initiating resolution workflows. It helps Scrum Masters proactively identify and resolve team blockers before they impact sprint velocity.

---

## üß† What It Does

* Monitors GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments for blocker indicators
* Scans Trello cards for blocker labels and keywords in descriptions
* Watches Slack channels for blocker-related messages and mentions
* Detects blocker patterns using AI analysis of team communications
* Automatically creates resolution tasks and assigns appropriate stakeholders
* Sends escalation notifications to Scrum Masters and team leads
* Tracks blocker resolution time and generates impediment reports
* Provides dashboard insights on team velocity impact

---

## üí° How to Use

### Automatic Detection
The workflow monitors continuously for blocker keywords and patterns:
- GitHub: `blocked`, `blocker`, `stuck`, `waiting for`, `dependency`
- Trello: Cards labeled with blocker tags or containing impediment keywords
- Slack: Messages with blocker mentions, help requests, and escalation patterns

### Manual Escalation
Team members can trigger immediate blocker processing:
```
@blocker-bot escalate [issue-link]
```

### Supported Blocker Types
- **Technical Blockers**: API dependencies, infrastructure issues, code conflicts
- **Resource Blockers**: Waiting for design, approval, external teams
- **Process Blockers**: Missing requirements, unclear specifications
- **External Blockers**: Third-party services, vendor dependencies

## üìå Configuration (Design Specification)

### Blocker Keywords Configuration
```js
return {
  blockerKeywords: {
    high_priority: ['blocked', 'blocker', 'critical dependency'],
    medium_priority: ['stuck', 'waiting for', 'needs approval'],
    low_priority: ['question', 'unclear', 'help needed']
  },
  
  escalationRules: {
    immediate: ['critical', 'production down', 'security'],
    urgent: 2, // hours before escalation
    standard: 24, // hours before escalation
    low: 72 // hours before escalation
  },
  
  stakeholderMapping: {
    'technical': ['tech-lead', 'senior-dev'],
    'design': ['design-lead', 'ux-team'],
    'product': ['product-owner', 'business-analyst'],
    'external': ['scrum-master', 'project-manager']
  },
  
  notificationChannels: {
    slack: {
      immediate: '#critical-alerts',
      escalated: '#team-blockers',
      resolved: '#standup-updates'
    },
    telegram: {
      scrum_master: 'SCRUM-MASTER-CHAT-ID',
      tech_leads: 'TECH-LEADS-GROUP-ID'
    }
  }
};
```

## ü§ñ AI Detection Prompts (Planned)

### Blocker Classification Prompt
> Analyze the following team communication for potential blockers or impediments:
>
> **Classification Goals:**
> 1. Identify if this represents a genuine blocker or just a question
> 2. Determine blocker type: Technical, Resource, Process, or External
> 3. Assess severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
> 4. Estimate impact on team velocity and sprint goals
> 5. Suggest appropriate stakeholders for resolution
>
> **Context:** `{communication_data}`
> **Team Info:** `{team_mapping}`
> **Current Sprint:** `{sprint_context}`

### Resolution Tracking Prompt
> Monitor the following blocker for resolution indicators:
>
> **Tracking Goals:**
> 1. Detect resolution signals in follow-up communications
> 2. Identify if blocker is being actively addressed
> 3. Flag if blocker requires escalation or additional resources
> 4. Measure time-to-resolution for reporting
>
> **Blocker Data:** `{blocker_context}`
> **Recent Activity:** `{activity_data}`
